                                                           
Thanks tor playing MISIFU REMEOW by JORDI                  
                                                           
I suppose you could miss the further adventures of Misifu  
                                                           
I guess you don't have to discover the plans for Dogad.    
                                                           
And one could probably go on without battling the dogs.    
                                                           
So go ahead and don't get full version.                    
                                                           
Sit on your comfy couch and let all of civilization.       
You've done your part, right?                              
                                                           
But if you've got real guts--let's go!                     
                                                           
Yes!
