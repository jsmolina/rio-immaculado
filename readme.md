RIO IMMACULADO
==============
Codebase structure inspired in https://github.com/msikma/allegro-4.2.2-xc by Michiel Sikma <michiel@sikma.org>

What happens if you mix "River City" + "Target Renegade" + "an 80s kid"? This crazy thing for the MS-DOS game contest.

*Compiling*

Just make. It will require allegro-4.2.2-xc in 'vendor'
